# About Me
I've been a Linux enthusiast for around 5 years now (as of 2022). It all started when my first Raspberry Pi for a birthday. I remember being so excited to use it, I heard that you could do so much with it! I was dumbfounded when I installed Raspbian and had to use the command line. Fast forward 5 years, and now I do it on all of my machines on the desktop - for fun, no less!

The distributions that hold my interest the most currently are:

- Debian
- Arch
- Gentoo

Lately, I've been configuring Gentoo on a new machine, and I'm in love with the experience so far. I'm looking to use more free and open source software wherever possible, and the Gentoo system makes that extremely easy with use flags and the @FREE flag. I really want to look at Trisquel, and may even write about it on here. 

Besides all that, I am trying to get into programming, so I may document my learning process here.
